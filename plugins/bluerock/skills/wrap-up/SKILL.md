  End-of-session ritual: log what this session did, refresh my BlueRock
  dashboard, then (with my go-ahead) commit, push, and hand me a continuation
  prompt for next time. Use when I say "wrap up", "done for today", "end
  session", "ship it", or "save my progress". Not for mid-session saves; only
  when the session is actually ending.

Wrap up this working session. Conversations end; the work persists. Make sure
everything this session produced survives into the next one: my dashboard
refreshed, the story logged, and — once I say so — committed and ready to pick
back up.

## Steps, in order

### 1. Review the session

Look back over this conversation and identify what got done (finished things,
not attempts), which files were created or changed, any decision I made that
future sessions should know about, and what's unfinished. Don't ask me to
summarize — you were here.

### 2. Refresh my dashboard

Real numbers, not guesses. First read this session's tokens + time honestly from
the Claude Code transcript:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/wrap-up/session-metrics.py"
```

(If it returns `{"ok": false}`, continue with zeros and note "metrics unavailable
this session.") Then:

- **Build this session's run atom(s)** — one per agentic run, contract shape:
  `{ ts, sessionId, agent, target, outputFile, runTimeSec, success, tokens,
  toolsCalled, filesRead, model, costUsd, guardrailEvents }`. Quantitative fields
  from the script; qualitative (agent, target, output) from the session. `model`
  = the canonical undated alias from the usage payload (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`).
- **Append the atom(s) to the run history** (keep all atoms, e.g. `.bluerock/runs.json`).
- **Tally today's priorities.** Read `today.md` and count Focus items: `set` (total),
  `closed` (`[x]`), `carried` (`[>]`). Offer to check off anything I finished this
  session that's still `[ ]`. This feeds the dashboard's "priorities set vs. closed."
- **Roll up the sections and overwrite the dashboard data file** so my dashboard
  repaints — match the pinned contract exactly, all keys present:
  `window.__BR_DASH__ = { meta, productivity, cost, actions, guardrail, perf, brag, priorities, runs }`
  (write it to the starter's `design/dashboard-data.js`). The renderer just paints —
  roll the sections up here, don't make the browser re-aggregate.

Provenance is a trust claim. Beta has **no BlueRock sensor pipeline**, so the label
is **"From your sessions,"** never "sensor-sourced." Specifically:
- `guardrail` = `{ wired: false, events: [] }`.
- `cost` only if a pricing table is present (tokens × price); otherwise zeros / placeholder — never a fabricated number under a trust label.
- `meta` (builder, workspace, region, trial) comes from the **workspace facts file** — read `~/.bluerock/workspace.json` (or `./.bluerock/workspace.json`). Compute `meta.trialDaysLeft = trial_days − (today − provisioned_at)`; take `builder` / `workspace` / `region` from the same file. **If the file is absent, degrade honestly:** omit the trial countdown (neutral "Trial," no number), generic builder name — never scrape boot time or file timestamps for the provision date (the container suspends/resumes, so those are wrong).
- `meta.outputsSince` is **singular "you," single user (not a team)**; `count` = outputs this week from `runs[]` (not a last-visit anchor); 0/unknown → greeting only, no fabricated number.
- `priorities` = `{ set, closed, carried }` for this week, counted from `today.md` (the closure loop). Derived "from your sessions," not sensors.
- `perf` = `{ successRate, runs:{successful,total}, avgSessionMin, avgSessionDeltaMin, outputsShipped }` — the honest set only. **No** output-quality/reader-rating and **no** cache-hit rate (dropped — no honest source / operator metric). `success` is your judgment (a run that completed without error or guardrail block); `avgSessionMin` from `session-metrics.py`; delta is neutral (shorter ≠ better).
- `resume` chapter comes from curriculum progress, not the transcript.

The source of truth for the shape + renderer is the builder's own design — the
data contract (`design/dashboard-data-contract.md`) and `dashboard.html`. Target
that contract; do not invent or restyle the dashboard.

### 3. Update the session log

Append an entry to `session-log.md` at the project root (create it with a one-line
title if it doesn't exist). Newest at the bottom, short — a trail, not a diary:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — [what this session was about, in a few words]

**Did:** [1-3 lines]
**Files:** [paths created or changed]
**Decided:** [only if a real decision was made; otherwise omit]
**Next:** [what the next session should pick up]
```

### 4. Show me what's about to be saved

Run `git status` and show me a plain summary: which files, new or changed, and a
proposed one-line commit message that says what the session accomplished (not
"updates"). **Wait for my go-ahead before committing.** "Wrap up" starts the
ritual; it is not yet permission to commit.

### 5. Commit and push (only after I confirm)

Once I confirm: stage the files, commit with the agreed message, push. If the
push fails (usually authentication), tell me plainly what happened and what to
click. Don't retry silently.

### 6. Hand me the continuation prompt

Last, print a short prompt I can paste into my next session:

```
I'm continuing work in my Hub.

Last session (YYYY-MM-DD): [one sentence: what got done]
Next up: [what to work on]

Read session-log.md for context.
```

That's the whole point of the ritual: the next session starts already knowing
what this one knew — and my dashboard already shows the work.

## Rules

- Never commit without my explicit go-ahead in this conversation.
- Never push anything that looks like a credential or a private key; flag it.
- If nothing changed this session, say so, still refresh the dashboard and log
  the session if I want the record, and skip the git steps.
